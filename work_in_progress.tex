\section{Work in progress}\label{work-in-progress}
\subparagraph{Reading of names} Given a forcing notion $(P,\leq)$ we have worked with different
relations $r\subseteq P\times V$ and when we had a generic filter $G$ on $P$ over $V$ we
considered semisets of the form $r[G]$. It is natural to look at the relation $r$ as an
approximation of this semiset. This approximation is a set from the groundmodel, in our case $V$.
The generic filter then `interprets' or `specifies' the exact meaning of $r$. In view of this,
we consider the relations to be `names' for semiset. We shall adopt the convention to `dot'
the relations, i.e. write $\dot{r}$ instead of $r$, when we want to emphasize that we are thinking
of them as names. We shall also write $\dot{r}/_G$ instead of $r[G]$.

Given a groundmodel set $x\in V$, we shall sometimes want to have a name for $x$, customarily
denoted by $\check{x}$. We could either choose $\check{x}$ to be some canonical relation
$\subseteq P\times x$ or, as we shall do here, we identify $\check{x}$ with $x$ and define
$\check{x}/_G$ to be $x$.

\subparagraph{Boolean names} \label{first-translation}
We have already mentioned, that the difference between an ordering $P$ and the complete Boolean
algebra $RO(P)$ is irrelevant from the point of view of forcing. However, working with a Boolean
algebra can sometimes be more convenient, since we can use the Boolean operations. We shall now
describe how to pass from $P$-names, i.e. relations $r\subseteq P\times V$, to appropriate
$B$-names (see also \ref{lost-in-translation}).

Starting with a name $r\subseteq P\times V$ we can consider the following modifications
$$\tilde{r} = \{\langle q,x\rangle:(\exists p\geq q)(\langle p,x\rangle\in r)\}$$
and
$$
\mathring{r} = \{\langle p,x\rangle: x\in rng(r)\ \&\ \{q\in P:\langle q,x\rangle\in\tilde{r}\}\ \mbox{is dense below}\ p\}.
$$
We immediately see that $dom(\tilde{r})=\bigcup\{(\leftarrow,p]:p\in dom(r)\}$ so $dom(\tilde{r})$
is downwards closed and $\tilde{r}[\{q\}] = \bigcup\{ r[\{p\}]:q\leq p\}$. Also, recalling
that a set $E\subseteq P$ is predense below $p\in P$ if there is no $q\leq p$ which would
be disjoint from $E$, i.e. $q\in E^\perp$, we see that $\langle p,x\rangle\in\mathring{r}$
iff $r^{-1}[\{x\}]$ is predense below $p$.

\begin{fact} It is clear that $r\subseteq\tilde{r}\subseteq\mathring{r}$ and, moreover,
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(i)] $\mathring{r}^{-1}[\{x\}]$ is a regular subset of $P$ for all $x$ (see \ref{Regularisation}).
 \item[(ii)] For any generic filter $G$ on $P$, the interpretations are the same, i.e. $r[G]=\tilde{r}[G]=\mathring{r}[G]$.
\end{itemize}
\end{fact}

The proof is straightforward. Note that in (ii) genericity of the filter $G$ is only needed for the last equality,
the first holds for any filter.


Using (i) and the fact that regular subsets of $P$ form a complete Boolean algebra denoted $RO(P)$ (see \ref{RO})
a relation $r\subseteq P\times V$ naturally determines a function $f:rng(r)\to RO(P)^+$, namely:
$$
f(x)=\mathring{r}^{-1}[\{x\}].
$$
For this function we have that for any generic filter $G$ on $P$
$$
r[G]=\{x:f(x)\in \bar{G}\},
$$
where $\bar{G}=\{x\in RO(P)^+: x\cap g\neq\emptyset\}$.

\subparagraph{Relationship between names and conditions}
We shall now introduce a piece of standard notation (see \ref{forcing-relation} for more details):
Given a name $\dot{r}\subseteq P\times V$, $x\in V$ and a condition $p\in P$ we shall write
$$
p\force x\in\dot{r}\ \mbox{or, more precisely}\ p\force\check{x}\in\dot{r}
$$
iff $\langle p,x\rangle\in\mathring{r}$. It is said that `the condition $p$ knows that $x$ is an element of $\dot{r}$'
or `p forces $\check{x}\in\dot{r}$.'.

What about $p$ forcing that $x$ is \emph{not} in $\dot{r}$. We might be tempted to that
$p\force \check{x}\not\in\dot{r}$ means $\langle p,x\rangle\not\in\mathring{r}$.
It turns out, however, that this would not work in general because $\langle p,x\rangle\not\in\mathring{r}$ might
mean that $p$ just doesn't know whether $\check{x}\in\dot{r}$. The correct definition
will be
$$p\force\check{x}\not\in\dot{r}\ \mbox{iff}\ p\ \mbox{is disjoint from all elements of}\ r^{-1}[\{x\}],$$
i.e. $p\in \{q\in P:q\force\check{x}\in\dot{r}\}^\perp$.

So in general, given a condition $p\in P$, a name $\dot{r}$ and an element $x\in V$ there are three possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(i)]   $p\force\check{x}\in\dot{r}$
 \item[(ii)]  $p\force\check{x}\not\in\dot{r}$
 \item[(iii)] $p$ does not know, i.e. there are (disjoint) elements $q_1,q_2\leq p$ such
              that $q_1\force\check{x}\in\dot{r}$ and $q_2\force\check{x}\not\in\dot{r}$.
\end{itemize}

The generic filter $G$ allows us to evade three valued or even intuitionistic logic since whenever
$p\in P\cap G$ such that $p$ does not decide $\check{x}\in\dot{r}$ the set
$$
H=\{ q\leq p:q\force\check{x}\in\dot{r}\ \vee\ q\force\check{x}\not\in\dot{r}\}
$$
is open dense below $p$ so there is $q\in G\cap H$ below $p$ which decides $\check{x}\in\dot{r}$.

\subparagraph{The role of dense subsets}
Consider a forcing notion $P$ with a dense subset $H\subseteq P$. In the previous chapter we have said that it does not matter
whether we work with $P$ or $H$. However, given a $P$-name $\dot{r}$ it is not immediately clear that this is an $H$-name.
In fact, it need not be, since, e.g. $dom(r)\cap H$ can be empty. To overcome this, we pass to $\tilde{r}$ for which we
necessarily have $dom(\tilde{r})\cap H\neq\emptyset$ (provided $dom(r)$ was nonempty). Moreover it turns out that for
each $h\in H$, $x\in V$ we have
$$
h\force\check{x}\in\dot{r}\ \mbox{iff}\ h\force\check{x}\in\tilde{r}
$$
An easy density argument now shows that $\dot{r}$ and $\dot{s}=\tilde{r}\cap H\times\dom(r)$ are names for the same semiset,
i.e. $\dot{r}/_G = \dot{s}/_G$ for each generic filter $G$.

\subparagraph{Equality of names}
When we will be trying to prove the consistency of the failure of CH, we will do this by adding semisets which are subsets of $\omega$.
For this to work we have to add a lot of different semisets, however we only have names for the semisets and we know, that different
names can be actually names for the same semiset. So it will be important to know, when two names are really names for different semisets.
We first start with the opposite question: When are two names $\dot{r}$ and $\dot{s}$ names for the same semiset?
The answer is that a condition $p\in P$ `knows' that the two $P$-names $\dot{r},\dot{s}$ are actually equal, i.e. $\dot{r}/_G=\dot{s}/_G$ for any generic $G$ containing $p$, iff for any $x\in rng(r)\cup rng(s)$ one of the following equivalent conditions is met:
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(i)]  $(\forall q\leq p)(r^{-1}[\{x\}]\ \mbox{is predense below}\ q\ \leftrightarrow s^{-1}[\{x\}]\ \mbox{is predense below}\ q)$
 \item[(ii)] $(\forall q\leq p)(q\perp r^{-1}[\{x\}]\leftrightarrow q\perp s^{-1}[\{x\}])$
\end{itemize}
If one of these conditions is met, we write $p\force\dot{r}=\dot{s}$ and we write $P\force\dot{r}=\dot{s}$ if all conditions
force $\dot{r}$ and $\dot{s}$ to be equal, i.e. iff $(\forall x\in dom(r)\cup dom(s) )((r^{-1}[\{x\}])^\perp = (s^{-1}[\{x\}])^\perp)$. This
implies that, necessarily, $rng(r)=rng(s)$.


{\bf Examples}

{\bf (i)} We say that $P$ forces $\check{x}\in\dot{r}$ if each $p\in P$ forces $\check{x}\in\dot{r}$. Clearly
$P\force\check{x}\in\dot{r}$ iff $r^{-1}[\{x\}]$ is predense in $P$ and $P\force\check{x}\not\in\dot{r}$ iff
$r^{-1}[\{x\}]=\emptyset$.

{\bf (ii)} Given two names $\dot{r},\dot{s}$ then
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(a)] $p\force\dot{r}=\dot{s}$ iff $(forall x\in rng(r)\cup rng(s))(\forall q\leq p)(q\force \check{x}\in\dot{r} \leftrightarrow q\force\check{x}\in\dot{s})$
 \item[(b)] $p\not\force\dot{r}=\dot{s}$ iff $(\exists q\leq p)(\exists x)(q\force\check{x}\in\dot{r}\ \&\ q\force\check{x}\not\in\dot{s}\ \vee\
                                                                           q\force\check{x}\in\dot{s}\ \&\ q\force\check{x}\not\in\dot{r})$
 \item[(c)] $p\force\dot{r}\neq\dot{s}$ iff $(\forall p_1\leq p)(\exists q\leq p_1)(q\not\force\dot{r}=\dot{s})$
\end{itemize}

{\bf (iii)}
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(a)] $P\force \dot{r}\subseteq\check{\omega}$ iff $rng(r)\subseteq\omega$
 \item[(b)] $p\force \dot{r}\subseteq\check{\omega}\ \&\ \dot{r}\ \mbox{is infinite}$ iff $rng(r)\subseteq\omega$ and
            $(\forall m<\omega)(p\force(\exists \dot{n})(\check{m}\leq \dot{n}\ \&\ \dot{n}\in\dot{r}))$ iff for all $m<\omega$ the set
            $r^{-1}[(\omega\setminus m)]$ is predense below $p$ iff for any generic filter $G$ with $p\in G$ the semiset $\dot{r}/_G$ is an
            infinite part of $\omega$.
 \item[(c)] $p\force\dot{r}\subseteq\check{\omega}\ \&\ \dot{r}\ \mbox{is finite}$ iff $rng(r)\subseteq\omega$ and
            $(\forall p_1\leq p)(\exists q\leq p_1)(\exists k<\omega)(q\in (r^{-1}[(\omega\setminus k)])^\perp)$.
\end{itemize}
{\bf (iv)} $P\force\dot{r}:\check{\omega}\to\check{\omega}$, i.e. $P$ forces that $\dot{r}$ is a mapping of $\omega$ into $\omega$ iff
           for each $p\in P$ the set
           $$
             r^\heartsuit(p) = \bigcup r[\ [p,\rightarrow)\ ]
           $$
           is a mapping of $P$ into partial functions from $\omega$ into $\omega$ and for any $n\in\omega$ the set
           $$
             \{p\in P:n\in dom(r^\heartsuit(p))\}
           $$
           is dense in $P$.

           Now suppose $B=RO(P)$ and $P\force \dot{r}:\check{\omega}\to\check{\omega}$. Then the name $\dot{r}$ determines an $(\omega,\omega)$-matrix
           on $B$ as follows:
           $$
           a(n,m)=\bigvee\{p\in P:\langle n,m\rangle\in r^\heartsuit(p)\}.
           $$
