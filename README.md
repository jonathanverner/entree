Entree to Generic Extensions and Set Theory

Annotated content

# Set Theory Prerequisites #

We mention the axioms of Zermelo - Fraenkel Set theory with axiom of choice (ZFC), transitive
sets and ordinal numbers. We define the $V_\alpha$ and $H_\kappa$ hierarchies to illustrate 
the possibilities of working with fragments of ZFC. We review well-founded relations, induction
and recursion. Some basics concerning trees are introduced together with an example of a 
well-founded ω-ary tree of rank α, for arbitrary α < ω1. We introduce the Mostowski collapse 
and elementary substructure techniques. We conclude the chapter with the definition of a semiset 
and some motivation for this concept.

This chapter is not intended to be self-contained but is rather meant as a quick summary of what
is needed in the sequel.

# Orderings and Boolean Algebras #

In this chapter we introduce many notions that are required to understand basic forcing com-
binatorics. We start with the definition of an ordering, its separative quotient and with some
basic combinatorial properties of orderings e.g. κ-cc, κ-closed, σ-centred. These properties are
illustrated on important orderings from forcing theory such as Cohen’s ordering, Collapsing or-
derings and Levi collapse. Rasiowa - Sikorski theorem. ∆-system lemma. We review the
concept of a (M)AD family on ω.

In the second half we define Boolean algebras and thoroughly investigate the connection betwixt
orderings, Boolean algebras and zero-dimensional compact Hausdorff spaces. We conclude this
chapter with a preparation for forcing techniques. Work with matrices and hierarchy of names.
Use of elementary submodels.

# Forcing Notion and Generic Filters #

First we define when orderings are forcing equivalent and introduce two criteria. We define
the generic object and discuss its existence. Some motivation for generic extensions and generic
objects is given. We conclude with the Balcar - Vopěnka
theorem about the canonical form of a generic object. Glimpse of a description of the generic extension.

# Classical Forcing Notions #

We start with a description of basic techniques that will be needed to introduce classical forcing
notions. More on working with names, Boolean names, forcing relation. We bring out many
phenomena known from forcing theory together with examples that illustrate these.

We start with ccc forcings that add new reals. Cohen forcing. Random forcing, measure algebra.
We show how to violate CH. Proof that ccc forcing preserves cardinalities and cofinalities.
Hechler forcing and adding a dominating real. Adding a filter pseudointersection. Non ccc
forcings. Mathias forcing, infinite Ramsey theory. Three parameter distributivity. Base tree
techniques.
